# BookSharp
Booksharp is a tour booking application created with C# on Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, for an Application Development project. 

## What BookSharp Can Do
- Provides a platform that has intuitive and user-friendly navigation, allowing customers to browse through all tours and/ or find their desired tours easily, and providing detailed information about said tours.

- On account creation, users will be given the choice of a premium account or free trial account. Free accounts will be deleted after 30 days. Premium accounts will give users the right to use themes, and will also give them a subsidy on their cart’s grand total.

- Allow users to change their account settings in the settings page, such as editing their UI theme for this session, their personal and payment information, as well as their membership (from free to premium).

- Let users filter and find tours based on their chosen criteria, such as location (continent and country) and price of tours

- Enable users to select their tour options on cart selection , such as hotel room choices and flight choices, while offering them an optional tour addon of travel insurance. 

- Make users select the date that their tour begins according to that tour’s available dates. Their selected tour date range will not be allowed to conflict with the existing date ranges of other cart tours.

- Allow users to save bookmarks for tours, which can be viewed even after they log out and sign in again 

- Allow users to leave reviews on the tour details page of their purchased tours through the review tab, as well as view other user’s reviews on the tour details page.

- Allow users to contact the company through the contact us page, which will email their message and email to the administrator’s email.
